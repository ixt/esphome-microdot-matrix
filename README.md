# esphome-microdot-matrix

A custom component for `esp-home` to drive the beautiful `LTP305` based LED Matrices from Pimoroni.
They produce this module in two forms, a standalone [LED Matrix Breakout][matrix_url] containing
two display modules, and a Raspberry Pi HAT called Microdot pHAT. 

I really love these little displays, but I wanted to free up some of my old Raspberry Pis driving
this display (thanks to the global shortage), and so I decided to make them work with ESP-Home, which
has a great API.

## Sources

This repo is built from Pimoroni's original implementation. More detail to follow.
